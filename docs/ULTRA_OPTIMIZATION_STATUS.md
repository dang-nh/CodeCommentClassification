## 🔬 Technical Details

### **Feature Engineering:**

**Text Representations:**
- Word TF-IDF: 20,000 features (4-grams)
- Char TF-IDF: 8,000 features (2-6 grams)
- Word Counts: 8,000 features (trigrams)
- **Total: 36,000 features**

**NLP Heuristics:**
- 60+ hand-crafted features

- Statistical features (length, ratios, bins)

**Feature Selection:**
- Chi-square selection
- Keeps top 8,000 most discriminative features
- **Final: 8,060 features per model**

---

### **Sampling Strategy:**

**ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling):**
- Triggers when minority class < 50% (was <30%)
- Generates synthetic samples adaptively
- Focuses on borderline/hard-to-learn examples
- Better than SMOTE for complex boundaries

**Example:**
```
Original: 2000 negative, 400 positive (20% minority)
After ADASYN: 2000 negative, ~1000 positive (33% minority)
```

---

### **Threshold Optimization:**

**Process:**
1. Train model, get probability predictions
2. Test 161 thresholds from 0.1 to 0.9
3. Find threshold that maximizes F1 score
4. Use optimal threshold for final predictions

**Example Results (Expected):**
```
Category         Default (0.5)  Optimized   Improvement
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ownership        99.0%         99.5%       +0.5%
deprecation      85.1%         88.0%       +2.9%
Collaborators    35.4%         42.0%       +6.6%  ← Big gain!
```

---

### **Voting Ensemble:**

**Architecture:**
```
Input → [Logistic Regression] ─┐
     → [Calibrated SVC]     ─┼→ Soft Voting → Prediction
     → [Random Forest]      ─┤   (Average Probabilities)
     → [Gradient Boosting]  ─┘
```

**Why Soft Voting:**
- Averages probability predictions
- Smoother than hard voting (majority)
- Leverages model confidence
- Better calibration with CalibratedCV

---

### **Hyperparameter Aggressiveness:**

**Logistic Regression:**
- C=10.0 (less regularization, was 5.0)
- ElasticNet l1_ratio=0.3 (more L2 stability)
- 5,000 max iterations (tighter convergence)

**Linear SVC:**
- C=2.0 (wider margin, was 1.5)
- tolerance=1e-5 (stricter convergence)
- Wrapped in CalibratedClassifierCV

**Random Forest:**
- 300 trees (more diversity, was 200)
- max_depth=25 (deeper, was 20)
- max_features='log2' (less correlation)

**Gradient Boosting:**
- 200 estimators (more boosting, was 150)
- learning_rate=0.2 (faster, was 0.15)
- max_depth=8 (more complex, was 7)
